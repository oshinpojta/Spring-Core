## *Assignments*

*Assignment1*
1) Create an Address class with the following attributes:- street, city, state, zip, country
Create an Customer class with the following attributes:- customerId, customerName,
customerContact, customerAddress.
Inject the Address bean into Customer bean using setter injection
Create a Test class with main() method, get Customer bean from ApplicationContext
object and print details of Customer.
Also write the JUnit Test cases for above program.
- Modify the above application and inject the bean using constructor injection
- Use XML based Configuraion.

*Assignment2*

2) Example of Injecting collections (List, Set and Map)
Create a class Question with following attributes: questionId, question, answers.
There are 3 cases for above program.
a. Write a program where answers is of type List<String> or String []
b. Write a program where answers is of type Set<String>
c. Write a program where answers is of type Map<Integer, String>
In case of Map, Integer value represents answerâ€™s sequence number.
d. Create a Test class with main() method, get Question bean from
ApplicationContext object and print question and its answers.
e. Also write the JUnit Test cases for above program.
- Use XML based configuration.
   
*Assignment3*

3) Example on autowiring
Design and Develop a Banking Application as follows:
a. Create a BankAccount class with following attributes: accountId,
accountHolderName, accountType, accountBalance
b. Create an interface BankAccountRepository with following methods:
public double getBalance(long accountId)
public double updateBalance(long accountId, double newBalance):
Note: Above method returns updated balance.
c. Create a class BankAccountepositoryImpl that implements
BankAccountRepository interface.
You can use database or any collection object as persistence store.
d. Create an interface BankAccountService with following methods:
public double withdraw(long accountId, double balance)
public double deposit(long accountId, double balance)
public double getBalance(long accountId)
public boolean fundTransfer(long fromAccount, long toAccount, double amont)
e. Create a class BankAccountServiceImpl that implements BankAccountService
interface.
f. Create a class BankAccount controller with following operations:
public double withdraw(long accountId, double balance)
public double deposit(long accountId, double balance)
public double getBalance(long accountId)
public boolean fundTransfer(long fromAccount, long toAccount, double amont)
g. Create a Test class with main() method, get BankAccountController bean object
from ApplicationContext and perform all the operations.
h. Also write the JUnit Test cases for above program.
- Use XML based configuration and perform autowiring with different types.
(byName, byType and constructor). Use one autowiring type at a time.

*Assignment4*

4) Example on @Controller, @Service, @Repository, @Autowired, @Configuration and
@Bean
Modify the above application, use annotations and java based configuration.

*Assignment5*

5) Write a program to demonstrate use of @Resource, @Inject, @Required annotations

*Assignment6*

6) Example of @Component, @Value, @PropertySource & Environment
a. Create a dbConfig.properties file which contains database configuration details
like driver class name, dburl, username, password.
b. Create a Java class in which you have to read all properties and display on a
console. (Use @Component, @Value or Environment and @PropertyResource).

*Assignment7*

7) Write a Java program to demonstrate SPEL (Spring Expression language)

*Assignment8*

8) Write a Java program to demonstrate InitializingBean and DisposableBean.
Try Different ways:
(Use init-method and destroy-method in xml config file)
(Use @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy)

*Assignment9*

9) Write a Java program to demonstrate Complete Bean Life cycle.

*Assignment10*

10) Write a java program to demonstrate ApplicationContextAware interface.
